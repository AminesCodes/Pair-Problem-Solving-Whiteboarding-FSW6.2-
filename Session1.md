# Core 6.2 Pair Whiteboarding Session 1


You will solve these problems on a whiteboard or a sheet of paper as a team of two. You will collaborate, discuss the problem, ask each other questions and make sure both of you understand the approach/solution before moving to the next step or question. 

You are not expected to solve all these questions. If you spend all the available time solving one question and at the end learned something that you didn’t know, That’s all that matters.

If you are done earlier or have questions reach out to Wynter, JR or me.

## Process
* Ask clarifying questions
* Write inputs/outputs
* Diagram and explain a solution to the problem
* Code your solution (on whiteboard or paper)
* Test and refactor your code (manually)
* Write it in JavaScript and see if works. (last)
 

## Questions

### Question 1
**Problem Statement:**
Write a function `sumFirstFiveEven` to find the sum of the first five even numbers in an array.
```
  Input: [3,7,-3,2,9,4,8,10,3,9,4,9,8,6,-2]
  Output: 28 
```

### Question 2
**Problem Statement:**
Write a function `findRepeated` that finds all elements in an array that appear more than once.
The function takes an array of numbers and returns a filtered array of those elements that appear more than once.
```
  Input: [1, 4, -2, -9, 2, -2, 1, 10, 4]
  Output: [-2, 1, 4]
```


### Question 3
**Problem Statement:**
Given a positive number n, return true if it contains a 1 digit.  Do not convert the number to a string.

Hint: use % to get the rightmost digit, and / to discard the rightmost digit. 

Challenge: Write it recursively.

```
hasOne(10) → true
hasOne(22) → false
hasOne(220) → false
```
